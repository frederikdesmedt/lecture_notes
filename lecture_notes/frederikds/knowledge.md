> Propositional attitudes := An attribute about a proposition, the relation between a human and an **information object**,
> for example: a belief, a goal, a hope, a promise, ...

The relation between knowledge and belief: a knowledge can be seen as a **justified true belief**, i.e., a belief that can be proven/justified to be true.

> Crisp information := an information that is either totally true of totally false.

> Vague knowledge := knowledge that contains imprecise terms: most, rather, a bit, ...

Declarative == descriptive in the context of this course, this is not the case in other domains, such as declarative programming languages.

> Procedure := a **description** of a dynamic process, not the process itself. For example: the laundry procedure is an information stored in our brain,
> actually doing the laundry is the dynamic process it describes.

Learning procedures can be seen as a kind of compilation from declarative knowledge to procedural knowledge (a procedure).
