Data Mining
===========

Observational data: not collected from some scientific process

Feature construction is the most important step in data mining!

Easy to make mistakes in preprocessing phase, yet in general lots of issues can arise in the data mining process -> redo it multiple times.

> Example of graph pattern: if A is friends with B and B is friends with C, how often will A be friends with C?
